      "description": "---\n**Authentication**\n  * Endpoint authentication is managed by API Keys. Keys are acquired in CATAPULT Web Office and assigned to individual <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-6/?page_id=15975\">Employee Records</a>. \n  * For security Best Practices, it is recommended to include the API Key value in the <code>X-ECRS-APIKEY</code> request header, instead of the query string, wherever possible. \n  * As an additional security measure, employee API Keys **do not** replicate between stores. This means API Keys created in a Web Office interface apply to that specific store location only. \n  * In addition, any <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-6/?page_id=40449\">Employee Record</a> marked as Inactive, Locked, or terminated (Termination Date is populated) will not be able to use their associated API Key with any endpoint in Passport API suite; no action will be taken through the endpoints in these scenarios.\n\nWhile it is recommended that calls be made to the HQ and filtered with available parameters, authentication for calls to non-HQ Web Office addresses are possible.\nThese require the creation of separate API Keys on employee records in the respective Web Office interface. For example:\n  \n  * Employee 142 has an API Key created on their maintenance record in the HQ Web Office. This can be used to authenticate requests sent to the HQ Web Office and will only display on the employee record when viewed in the HQ Web Office interface.\n  * Employee 142 has another API Key created on their maintenance record in the RS1 Web Office. This will be used to authenticate requests sent to the RS1 Web Office and will only display on the employee record when viewed in the RS1 Web Office interface.\n  \nThe API Key visible in the HQ Web Office interface is used to authenticate HQ requests, while the API Key from the RS1 Web Office interface is used for RS1 requests.\n\n**Content Negotiation & Media Types** \\\nCatapult Passport API operations support these response content-types in the request <code>accept:</code> header:\n  \n  * application/xml\n  * application/json\n  * text/csv\n  \nAPI response content-type is determined by agent-driven, or client-based, content negotiation.\nResponse content-type will default to XML data format if the incoming request header does not describe a specific accept value.\n\n**CSV Format Requirements** \\\nXML and JSON data formats are unconditionally accepted by all Catapult Passport API endpoints. \nThe CSV data format is likewise accepted by all endpoints, provided the incoming request satisfies the neccessary formatting criteria:\n* The CSV file must always start with a header row that names each column.\n* Each column is delimited by a comma <code>,</code>.\n* Each row is delimited by 1 or more carriage return and/or newline characters.\n* A single-quote <code>'</code> character placed after a row or column delimiter will start the next row or column as quoted.\n* Quoted columns do not terminate until the next single-quote character is encountered.  \n* Single-quotes within an quoted column can be escaped by a back-slash <code>\\\\</code> character.\n* A row or column delimiter must be placed immediately after each single-quote termination (after closing a quoted row or column).\n\n**Data Type Requirements** \\\nCertain data types allow for more leeway with accepted values, while others expect a strict input format. For consistency, unless where otherwise noted and when present in a query parameter,\nthe data types listed here will acccept: \n* **Boolean** - Standard <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> values or binary <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> numeric values.\n* **Date Time** - Time-zone optional, separator-agnostic <code>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss</code> or <code>YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss</code> ISO8601/RFC3339 format.\n* **Empty String** - Pair of double-quotes without a space separator, such as <code>parameter=\"\"</code>.\n* **Currency** - Standard decimial-separated USD format, such as <code>12.50</code>\n\n**Network Connectivity Requirements** \\\nPerforming requests or updates via the Passport Services API is not possible over Wide-Area-Network (WAN) connections without an active VPN. Requests are only accepted from the same environment where cardholder data is located. More specifically, requests are only accepted from non-routable RFC1918 private network addresses; communication is not possible with any cloud-based platforms or applications. \n\n**Licensing Requirements** \\\nIn order for a CATAPULT merchant - or their chosen third party - to perform requests through the Passport Services API, the CATAPULT store that contains the database where requests will be sent must have one of the following \"Passport API\" licenses enabled:\n\n  * **Passport API Read Only** - This license allows authorized personnel to submit requests to endpoints that only support <code>GET</code> methods (e.g., Transaction Journal, Items, Dynamic Promotions, etc.). Endpoints that support a variety of methods - such as Customers and Maintenance Profiles - cannot be sent requests with this license, even though they support one or more <code>GET</code> methods. In turn, this means that no updates to the merchant's CATAPULT database can be made via Passport Services API with this license. Please note, responses like \"Passport APIs are not licensed for this server\" and \"The requested service is not valid\" will be returned should a request be made to an ineligible endpoint. \n  * **Passport API Read & Write** - This license allows authorized personnel to use all Passport Services API endpoints to the fullest by submitting <code>GET</code> requests and/or performing <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, or <code>DEL</code> updates. \n  \nPlease note that unique licenses cannot be assigned to individual users of the Passport Services API for each store. Meaning, if User 1 and User 2 both needed to submit requests via the Passport Services API to a store, both users would have the same level of access (i.e., Read Only or Read/Write); User 1 could not have Read Only access while User 2 had Read/Write.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n* All Passport API endpoints do not use an employee's assigned Authorization Security checkpoints to determine access. Instead, an employee's Inactive status is used. \n * If an employee with a valid API Key is NOT marked as \"Inactive\" (on their record in CATAPULT Web Office), then that employee will have access to query all Passport API endpoints.\n * If an employee with a valid API Key IS marked as \"Inactive\", then that employee will not be able to query any Passport API endpoint.\n* Endpoint operations are only accessible to requests that originate from the same local, non-routing private network or VPN as the HQ.\n* API events are output to the CATAPULT web server and can be found in the \\\\Tomcat X.X\\\\logs\\\\ directory, for example: api.YYYY-MM-DD.log\n* Use a unique batch number for different batch procedures. This will make it easier to identify related batch events in the batch_importMessages table and filter for a specific batch number.\n* Passport includes XML v1.1 formatting. Most browsers do not currently support XML v1.1 formatting and should therefore not be relied on, if used at all, for accurate troubleshooting. A dedicated API testing platform is recommended."

Use **<font color=\"#2F8132\">GET</font>** to retrieve.\n\nWhen a startTime and/or endTime are entered in the request parameters, the TransactionJournal query uses\nthe timestamp from the TRN_uploadTime field to determine if a transaction should be included in the response. \nThis is an important distinction as the TRN_uploadTime defines if, and when, a transaction record \nis inserted in the HQ T-Log. As such, transactions with a TRN_uploadTime timestamp after the startTime, \nand/or before the endTime, will be returned."

If you have constructed Item Groups with a large number of items (e.g., 100,000 or more), and attached those Item Groups to the Dynamic Promotions returned within the query parameters, the performance of this endpoint may be impacted. Specifically, it may take an extended period of time for the responses to be returned.\n   - Due to the data being separated by ASCII control characters GS (Group Separator) and RS (Record Separator), the CSV response for this endpoint becomes less useful, as most text editors fail to render those characters. Instead, the recommendation is to use either the JSON or XML response output for this endpoint."

Each endpoint is limited to **<font color=\"#2774B8\">POST</font>** requests unless where noted otherwise in the operation description.\n  - External links to the CATAPULT Online Manual (OLM) are included for additional clarification of terms, fields, parameters, and data points where applicable.\n  \n### Notes\n  - When any of the Batch Update endpoints are used, the associated data is temporarily stored in a table within the CATAPULT database at the store (where the endpoint was used). After the data is processed for any of the endpoints, the table will be automatically cleared/purged to prevent bloat. This self-cleaning behavior cannot be changed or modified, and no action is required for it to occur.\n  - **With CATAPULT 5.7.142 and newer**, if the Staging Tables are used outside of the Batch Update endpoints, please note that the database tables associated with each endpoint - except for <code>batch_ImportMessages</code> - will be cleared upon database restart.

        "description": "### CATAPULT Version Requirements\nOnly Available with CATAPULT 5.7.135+\n### Overview\nThe <code>giftCardBulk</code> method allows for you to perform a **<font color=\"#2774B8\">POST</font>** request to the CATAPULT Database to create and automatically activate a bulk set of Electronic Gift Cards (i.e., E-Gift Cards). This method is useful if your business needs to fulfill a large order of gift cards for a customer (i.e., corporate Christmas gifts). \n\nWhen using this method to generate the E-Gift Cards, you must specify the quantity of the E-Gift Cards that need to be generated, in addition to the pre-loaded dollar amount that needs to be on each E-Gift Card. You can optionally choose the numerical prefix of the E-Gift Card's code, while the option to choose if the E-Gift Cards require a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to complete payment is also available. \n\nWhen the E-Gift Cards are successfully generated, the response to the request will contain the following information about each E-Gift Card:\n  - E-Gift Card Number\n  \n  - Beginning Balance (i.e., the pre-loaded amount)\n  \n  - E-Gift Card PIN (if present)\n  \n  - The Employee ID, First Name, and Last Name of the employee who performed the request to generate the E-Gift Cards (as entered on their Employee Record in CATAPULT Web Office)\n  \n  - The date and time at which the E-Gift Card was generated\n  \nWith this E-Gift Card information, you can use it as needed (e.g., take the data and print it on physical cards, send out emails with the E-Gift Cards to the desired recipients, etc.). \n\nAll information about each E-Gift Card will be stored in the CATAPULT database, which will in turn allow shoppers to use their E-Gift Card at any store location in the enterprise. In addition, because each E-Gift Card is activated upon creation, the E-Gift Card recipients can immediately use their card as a purchasing tender. \n\n### Authentication Requirements\nA store employee with an Employee Record in CATAPULT Web Office must perform the <code>giftCardBulk</code> request and must properly authenticate to do so. Specifically, this employee must meet the following authentication requirements:\n  - Have a valid API Key (generated on the Employee Record in CATAPULT Web Office)\n  \n  - Must be \"Active\" (i.e., the *Inactive* checkbox must not be selected on their Employee Record in CATAPULT Web Office)\n  \n  Should the employee performing the request not meet any of the authentication requirements, a <code>403</code> \"Error\" response will be returned. \n  \n### Authorization Requirements\n  - A store employee with an Employee Record in CATAPULT Web Office must perform the <code>giftCardBulk</code> request and must have the **Gift Card Bulk Load** checkpoint enabled in their assigned Authorization Security profile. \n  \n  - Should the employee performing the request not meet this authorization requirement, a <code>403</code> \"Error\" response will be returned. \n    - In these scenarios, if the unauthorized employee has the *Gift Card Bulk Load* checkpoint enabled at a later time, note that it may take up to five (5) minutes from the time the checkpoint is enabled for the employee for the changes to take effect. \n      - **EXAMPLE:** If the *Gift Card Bulk Load* checkpoint is enabled for an employee at 1:30 P.M., they will not be able to perform the <code>giftCardBulk</code> request until 1:35 P.M.\n\n### Reporting\nWhen a store employee (with an Employee Record in CATAPULT Web Office) performs the <code>giftCardBulk</code> request, and E-Gift Cards are successfully generated, the Employee ID, First Name, and Last Name of the employee - as entered on their Employee Record - will be permanently associated with that E-Gift Card creation record in the CATAPULT database. \n\nYou can report on and verify the \"creating employee\" information in CATAPULT Web Office 5.7.136+ using the <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-7/?page_id=423557\">Gift Card Balances</a> report. This report allows you to view the \"creating employee\" information for each E-Gift Card, in addition to viewing the current balance of each card. \n\n### Limitations\n  - The <code>giftCardBulk</code> method can only be used to **create** CATAPULT (i.e., \"self hosted\") E-Gift Cards. It cannot be used to update anything about pre-existing CATAPULT Gift Cards. Likewise, it cannot be used to create or update any Third-Party Gift Cards. \n  \n  - **General Ledger (GL) Accounts**\n    - If your business uses the <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-7/?page_id=252913\">General Ledger (GL) Accounts</a> module with CATAPULT, you can opt to select a GL Profile as the \"Gift Card Liability Account\" for Gift Cards. This is done on the *Gift Card* plugin of the <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-7/?page_id=252635\">Transaction Security profile</a>. \n    \n    - **<font color=\"#e33e17\">IMPORTANT:</font>** If a GL profile is chosen for the Gift Card Liability Account, using the <code>giftCardBulk</code> method does NOT Debit or Credit the account.Instead, the General Ledger entries must be imported into CATAPULT from the third party accounting system in these scenarios.

As such, shoppers who use the E-Gift Cards must enter this PIN at Point of Sale to complete payment. \n    - For security, each E-Gift Card's PIN will be a randomly generated four-digit numeric code, and this randomization will occur for each E-Gift Card generated. \n    - Each E-Gift Card's PIN will only be visible in the <code>SecurityCode</code> field within the response.

This snapshot is created so that you can make as many requests as needed to get all of your (paged) data without the system having to obtain and build the data repeatedly. \n  - Each snapshot is maintained over a 3-minute sliding expiration period. Meaning, it will only expire 2-3 minutes after the last request for the data takes place. \n  - Each snapshot is maintained per API Key + Store + Value of <code>since</code> Parameter; any subsequent requests for a specific Key/Store/Since combination will pull from the snapshot that was created.\n\n### Requirements\n  In order to use the <code>/labelDataExport</code> endpoint, the three requirements detailed below must be met:\n  \n#### 1) Authentication\nAny user who calls the <code>/labelDataExport</code> endpoint must meet the following authentication requirements:\n  - Have a valid API Key (generated on a designated Employee Record in CATAPULT Web Office)\n  \n  - The designated Employee Record must be \"Active\" (i.e., the *Inactive* checkbox must not be selected on their Employee Record in CATAPULT Web Office)\n  \n  Should the user calling the endpoint not meet any of the authentication requirements, a <code>400</code> \"Error\" response will be returned.\n  \n#### 2) Application of Advanced Settings\nTwo Advanced Settings must be applied in CATAPULT Web Office to allow a user to call the <code>/labelDataExport</code> endpoint:\n  - **Advanced Setting #1**\n    - **KEY**\n      - unified.label.enabled\n    - **VALUE**\n      - true \n    - **LEVEL**\n      - Store Level - Headquarters\n    - **REQUIRED**\n      - Yes\n      \n  - **Advanced Setting #2**\n    - **KEY**\n      - LabelDataExportFilterName\n    - **VALUE**\n      - *Name of Global Inventory Filter*\n    - **LEVEL**\n      - Store Level - Headquarters\n    - **CONTEXT**\n      - By default, when the <code>/labelDataExport</code> request is performed, all items in the store's CATAPULT database will be returned. To limit the returned results to only applicable \"deli items\", a <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-7/?page_id=251883\"> Global Inventory Filter</a> must be created and saved. \n      - The created Global Inventory Filter must contain criteria that will only allow the desired items to be returned in the result set. This filter criteria will vary depending on your item set, but examples might include items within a certain Department, items with a specific Nutrition Fact Label Format, or any eligible combination of the available Inventory Filter points.\n      - The created Global Inventory Filter should contain filter criteria that will EXCLUDE items marked as \"Discontinued\" from the result set, as these items will be included by default.\n      - Once created and saved, the entered **Name** of the Global Inventory Filter filter will be used as the VALUE of the Advanced Setting.\n        - When a Global Inventory Filter is created and saved, CATAPULT Web Office appends \"(Global)\" to the end of the filter name to indicate to all users the scope of the filter. This appended text should NOT be included in the Advanced Setting VALUE. \n        - **EXAMPLE** - If a Global Inventory Filter is created, saved, and named \"Label Data Export Filter\", it will appear as **Label Data Export Filter (Global)** in CATAPULT Web Office. With this, only the filter's name (e.g., \"Label Data Export Filter\") would be entered as the Advanced Setting's VALUE. \n    - **REQUIRED**\n      - Yes\n\nFor more information on applying Advanced Settings in CATAPULT Web Office, <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-7/?page_id=287221\"> click here</a> to view the *HOW TO: Add, Edit, and Delete an Advanced Setting* article in the ECRS Online Manual. \n\n#### 3) API Endpoint Call Must Use Headquarters Web Office URL\n  - When the <code>/labelDataExport</code> endpoint is called a URL will be used. This URL must use the Account ID of the **Headquarters** store in the enterprise. \n  - Even though the Headquarters Web Office URL must be used, data for a specific store in the enterprise can be returned by using the <code>storeNumber</code> query parameter.

New entries\nare added to their respective tables when not found in the database.\n\nSee also: <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-6/?page_id=380#IG-general\">Inventory Maintenance</a>.\n\n## New Item Behavior\n  - New items created by this batch process will inherit all applicable department default values associated with the Department Number \nentered in the batch record. Additional item hierarchy defaults are pulled from the Sub-Department Number, Category Number, \nSub-Category Number, and Variety Number field values, if subsequently entered in the batch record. The full item hierarchy (numbers) \nmust be included to update or insert item records.\n\n  - New items will have pricing records created for all zones. Specifically, the item's <code>promptForPrice</code> setting will be set to enabled (i.e.,  <code>1</code>) on Price Level 1 and \ndisabled (i.e., <code>0</code>) with a dollar value of $0.00 on Price Levels 2-4. \n    - To override this default behavior and have new items be added with <code>promptForPrice</code> disabled and a $0.00 Base Price on Price Level 1, apply the following (global) Advanced Setting:\n      > KEY = stagingTables.NewItemsAddWithZeroPrice \\\n      > VALUE = true\n\n## Batch Process Updates and Message Log\n  - Batch processing status and log can be viewed by calling the <code>/batch/importMessages</code> endpoint.\n  - Beginning with CATAPULT 5.7.143 and newer, if one or more items within a batch fails or encounters an error, the items that failed - and why - will be included in the <code>detail</code> line of the *importMessages* response.

With this in mind, if any of the following fields within a batch are different, an entirely new worksheet will be created for the row that is different. Therefore, if you want to ensure that all rows within a batch populate the same worksheet, it's important to ensure that the following fields in all rows match.  \n      * name\n      * zoneName\n      * startDate\n      * endDate\n      * commitAtStore\n      * worksheetTypeProfileName (available with CATAPULT 5.6.121 and newer)\n   * Beginning with CATAPULT version 5.6.107, should the *Batch Price and Cost* endpoint initially fail to commit a worksheet, it will reattempt the commit until successful (up to 10 times). After 10 failed attempts, the importMessages for that worksheet will display an 'E' (for error), at which point you will need to commit the worksheet through CATAPULT Web Office.",

When entered in a row of the request body,the category corresponds to the type of maintenance record ultimately called by the <code>entityId</code> in the same row.\n\n**EXAMPLE** - A request is posted to update <code>entityId</code> '40000001234' in Category 'C' with a new email. This instructs the Address procedure that a **Customer** record (i.e., Category 'C') where <code>customerId</code> = <code>entityId</code> is to receive the new Address Description. \n\n**Beginning with CATAPULT 5.6.112+**, this endpoint will only update addresses for records where the system detects there is a change (or a new address is being added).

Up to nine (9) digits, spread across three (3) parameters, can be used to define the exact shelf sequnce for a given record. \nEach row in this batch defines the sequence for one such record: it's recommended to use a unique batch number for each store.\nThis way you can easily adjust multiple inventory records for a single store location, then call importMessages for those store-specific changes using the unique batch number.\nNote the full sequence number of an inventory record's shelf location sequence will be the combined three sequence parts from the query parameters:\nleading zeroes will be automatically included, where necessary, to ensure each sequence is nine (9) digits.</font>\n\n> For example, a complete shelf sequence of <code>001002003</code> would be entered in the parameters as: \\\n> sequencePart1 = <code>001</code> \\\n> sequencePart2 = <code>002</code> \\\n> sequencePart3 = <code>003</code> \n\nSee also: <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-6/?page_id=400#shelf-information-tab\">Inventory Maintenance Shelf Information</a>, <a href=\"https://olm.ecrs.com/5-6/?page_id=16668\">Item Shelf Sequence in HHT</a>.\n\n*Batch processing status and log can be viewed by calling the /batch/importMessages endpoint.*",
